These generally run quickly, and you'll know code execution is complete when the \"arrow\" to the left of the cell is shown again. When you select the next cell you will see a number showing the order in which the code blocks were executed.  If you want an output when a code block is run you can always choose to place a print statement at the end of the block.\n","* The state for a notebook is global so even if you remove the definition of a variable once a cell has been run, it will still be defined.  Go to the `Runtime` menu and select \"`Restart runtime...`\" if you want to reset the runtime.  After doing this you will need to re-run the cells.  If you have made some changes to fix a bug, you might want to do this to be sure you are starting from a fresh state.\n","* Code is executed in a virtual machine dedicated to your account. Virtual machines are recycled when idle for a while, and have a maximum lifetime enforced by the system. You will need to rerun all cells when your virtual machine is recycled.\n","* Within the `Runtime` menu you can use \"`Run all`\", `\"Run before`\", or \"`Run after`\" to run multiple cells at once.\n","* Use the `+ CODE` button between cells (or at the top) to add a cell for code.\n","* Use the `+ TEXT` button between cells (or at the top) to add a cell for text.\n","* To edit a text cell double click on it and then edit using the [mark-up language](https://colab.research.google.com/notebook#fileId=/v2/external/notebooks/markdown_guide.ipynb).\n","\n","## Labs that use the UCI Automobile Data Set for Predicting Real-Valued Labels (Regression)\n","\n","We start with the  UCI Automobile data set since it is an easy to understand data set that has missing data and both numerical and categorical data.\n","\n","We start with using Pandas to load and explore the raw data.

We had introduced bucketized features earlier but in the first lab on this data sets introduces quantiles as a way to avoid hand picking the thresholds and also combines the bucketized features with the raw features. The next step to further improve a linear model is to introduce feature crosses.  After doing this, the students should begin to see some overfitting so it’s natural to introduce L2 regularization, and then L1 regularization to reduce the model size.  Finally, a DNN can be introduced and compared to a linear model.  Students should begin to think about the pros and cons in moving from a linear model with crosses to a DNN.\n","\n","###[Lab 8: Train a Linear Classifier with Numerical and Categorical Features](https://colab.research.google.com/notebook#fileId=/v2/external/notebooks/intro_to_ml_semester_course/Lab_8__Training_a_Linear_Classifier_with_Numerical_and_Categorical_Features.ipynb)\n","\n","**Learning Objectives:**\n","* Introduce logistic regression to train a binary classifier.\n","* Understand metrics such as ROC curves, AUC, log loss, classification errors.\n","* Train a linear classifier using the raw numerical and categorical features.\n","\n","###[Lab 9: Bucketized Features using Quantiles and Feature Crosses](https://colab.research.google.com/notebook#fileId=/v2/external/notebooks/intro_to_ml_semester_course/Lab_9__Bucketized_Features_Using_Quantiles_and_Feature_Crosses.ipynb)\n","\n","**Learning Objectives:**\n","  * Learn to use quantiles to create bucketized features.\n","  * Learn how to introduce feature crosses.\n","  * Starting from just having the data loaded, train a linear classifier to predict if an individual's income is at least 50k using numerical features, categorical features, bucketized features, and feature crosses.\n","\n","###[Lab 10: Regularization to Reduce Overfitting and Model Size](https://colab.research.google.com/notebook#fileId=/v2/external/notebooks/intro_to_ml_semester_course/Lab_10__Regularization_to_Reduce_Overfitting_and_Model_Size.ipynb)\n","\n","**Learning Objectives:**\n","* Replace the `StochasticGradientDescent` optimizer by the `FTRLOptimizer`\n","* Use L2 regularization to help reduce overfitting\n","* Use L1 regularization to create sparsity and reduce model size\n","* Look at ROC curves to understand trade-off between model size and accuracy\n","\n","###[Lab 11: Train a DNN](https://colab.research.google.com/notebook#fileId=/v2/external/notebooks/intro_to_ml_semester_course/Lab_11__Train_A_DNN.ipynb)\n","\n","**Learning Objectives:**\n","* Train a DNN and compare the performance to that when using a linear model with feature crosses and bucketized features."]},{"metadata":{"id":"xT8U2H7HM6bz","colab_type":"text"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Lab to Apply Embeddings for Movie Review Sentiment Analysis\n","\n","The final data set introduces the students to training embeddings in a DNN with the application are of sentiment analysis.\n","\n","###[Lab 12: Learning Embeddings](https://colab.research.google.com/notebook#fileId=/v2/external/notebooks/intro_to_ml_semester_course/Lab_12__Learning_Embeddings.ipynb)\n","\n","**Learning Objectives:**\n","* Represent movie-review as a bag of words\n","* Implement a sentiment-analysis linear model\n","* Implement a sentiment-analysis DNN model using an embedding that projects data into two dimensions\n","* Visualize the embedding to see what the model has learned about the relationships between words"]},{"metadata":{"id":"toBbp_mHNL1J","colab_type":"text"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["##Extra Credit Lab: Training a DNN to Predict a Real-Valued Label (Regression)\n","\n","###[Training a Deep Neural Network for a Regression Problem](https://colab.research.google.com/notebook#fileId=/v2/external/notebooks/intro_to_ml_semester_course/Extra_Credit_Lab__Training_a_DNN_for_a_Regression_Problem.ipynb)\n","\n","**Learning Objectives:**\n","* Train a DNNRegressor on the housing data exploring different configurations of hidden units and choices of features to include.\n","* Another option is to introduce bucketized features and crosses and compare what you can do with a linear model using those as compared to a DNN.\n","* Another option is to introduce dropout as an alternate to L2 regulariz"]}]}
